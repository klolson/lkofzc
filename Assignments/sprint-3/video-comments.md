# Summary of CHAOSS Evolution Meeting
    
    Added aggregators and parameters headers to the evolution working group metric template. Then proceeded to review the 
    inactive contributors metric proposed by someone from class. It was decided that the goal was to keep the word count for 
    the metric drafts low, which means redundancy should be avoided. Talked a lot about the wording for when a 
    contributor hasn't made a contribution in a long period of time and is therefore inactive. The original wording used was
    period for the time frame that we're interested in measuring and cutoff for the amount of time it takes for a 
    contributor to become inactive after not contributing. In general, the conclusion that was reached was that inactive
    contributors is a useful metric, and the implementation was mostly correct it was just the wording that needed to be 
    adjusted so the draft is more concise. 
    Near the end of the meeting, the group discussed the value of having state type metrics (a metric that takes a snapshot
    of a project). The example used for this type of metric was the create code length metric, which looked at examining the
    length of code.
