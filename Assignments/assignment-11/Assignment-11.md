I plan to attend the April 8 at 9am CDT: Evolution Working Group call.

	Something I found interesting about the podcast is that there are a wide variety of people with different backgrounds involved in the CHAOSS project. Originally, I thought it was just comprised of a bunch of coders and computer science people, so it was pretty interesting to hear about the different backgrounds and experiences of the people in the podcast. In a way it's quite analogous to the idea of community health, in order to have a healthy community it is important to have people with different backgrounds and experiences involved as that means you will have a wider variety of ideas and inputs. Which is why it's pretty cool to see that the members of the CHAOSS project come from a wide variety of places, whilst all sharing a love of community health and engagement. It's good to see that the members of the CHAOSS project engage in good community health practices for their own community.
