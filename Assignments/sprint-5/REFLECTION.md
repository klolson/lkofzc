# Reflection

## What worked and what didn't
* From following the vimeo examples I was able to get both the dex and flask projects to work sucessfully
* The only challenging part was trying to locate my virtualenv folder as my file structure is not very organized
* Once I was able to locate all of the proper files getting the two different apps to build was pretty easy
* Both projects were able to login and authenticate properly as well as take the user to a restricted page after a successful login

## Sites used to help build the projects

## What I hope to have functioning with SSO
* I think I would like to work on a project that utilizes the youtube api.
* The app would require the user to login to their google account through the SSO.
* Then the app would display youtube data related to that user such as their videos or playlists.
* Furthermore the app might extend some basic functionality of the youtube service, such as allowing for basic video searches.
* The overall end goal of the app would be to simplify the retrieval of youtube data by the user, becuase as of now someone logged into youtube has to navigate through their settings to find analytics for their channel.
  * Ideally, someone could observe the viewership over time for a video for example.
* Essentially the app would be focused on retrieving specific youtube data for the user.
