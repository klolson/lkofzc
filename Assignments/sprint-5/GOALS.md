# Overall web app goals
* I want to make a web app that utilizes the youtube api.
* The overall purpose will be to extend certain features supported by Youtube which are "hidden" behind multiple layers of settings.
  * The primary function of the web app will be to ease the retrieval of video analytics. Things like views, subscribers, and like/dislike ratio should all be easily retrieved for any given video. 
  * A secondary goal would be to create some sort of visualization for video analytics so that a content creator could see their viewership and subscriptions over a period of time. These visualizations would probably take the form of some sort of line graph.
* The general user base will be people who have youtube accounts.
* The app will be used to display data related to a user's account.
* A secondary feature could be added to extend basic search and upload features already supported by youtube.
