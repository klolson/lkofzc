# Article Reflection

## Article 1
I found all of the different reasons for people to contribute to open source pretty interesting and even eye opening. For
instance the idea that altruism is not the main motivator behind working on open source is a little surprising to me. I always
thought that people worked on open source projects because they were passionate about the ideas behind the project. I never 
realized that many people work on open source for more personal reasons, and they don't just neccesarily work on these projects
"for the fun of it". It seems like many people are incentivised to work on these projects because either they see it as a way
to boost their resume and strengthen job prospects or their employer is directly paying them to work on the project. Overall,
I don't think this is a bad thing, the fact of the matter is that many of these open source projects wouldn't get by without
extensive involvement and support from the community so it's good that there are incentives for people to work on these projects
as otherwise many of them would probably eventually fall apart.

## Article 2
Something I found interesting about this article was the idea that open source projects actually have a large amount of 
structure and organization to them. I used to think that open source projects were a tangled mess of jumbles of code slapped
together by contributors across the world who rarely communicated with each other. This really doesn't make sense at all though,
as any successful team endeveaor requires extensive group communication and collaboration so it makes sense that open source is
built off of communication and organization. I had no idea that many open source projects had an extensive hiarchy that ranges
from users all the way to mantainers. Again this makes sense, as open source wouldn't nearly be successful if just anyone could
modify the project, some sort of quality control has to be mantained in order for the project to function in a concise and clear
manner.
