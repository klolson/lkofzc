# A Open Source license I'm interested in using
The license that I would be the most interested in using would have to be the GNU General Public License version 2. The reason
that I would to use this specific license is because it seems to place a great importance on the original creator of software.
I like that it stresses that it gives people the freedom to alter their software, as well as distribute it either for free or
at a cost. Something else that I liked about this software is that it places a copyright and disclaimer on you original software
so if someone alters it and introduces problems into the software it does not reflect negativley against your reputation since,
new users are notified that the software they're using is not the original version. All in all, the GNU license seems to emphasise
protecting the personal freedom of software engineers both by granting them the freedom to distribute and change their software
as well as by protecting them from outside patents on modified versions of the source code, ensuring that their credibility
remains intact.
