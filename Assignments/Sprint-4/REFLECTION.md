## Project Descriptions
+ Sails: Sails is a backend web framework. It is used to build Node.js web apps. Sails contains an object which holds a collection of unique "routes". These routes have two parts an address on the left and a target on the right. The address is composed of a URL and an HTTP method, whenever a request is recieved Sails compares it with the address and if a match is found the request is passed onto the target. So essentially Sails is a framework that handles requests and deals with them appropriatly.
+ Hydra: Ory Hydra is a web authentification software. Typically it is used to allow clients to gain access to owner resources without gaining control over said resources. An owner can give someone limited access by defining a scope and time period for when that access is granted. Therefore, the owner doesn't have to worry about giving up control of their resources to a third party since the user has limited access through the use of a token which allows the user to access information which doesn't require the owners password/credentials.

## Why I chose Sails
I chose sails becuase I felt that the documentation as well as their tutorials were all very clear and easy to follow. Their documentation was presented in a concise manner which allowed me to set up a sails app with minimum conflict. Also, the use of routes to handle HTTP methods seemed like a very interesting efficient way to handle user requests.

## How far I got into making it work
I was able to get a fully functioning app up and running. Inside my sails app there is support for logging in and even creating a user. Furthermore when a user logs in they get access to a unique modal that non registered users can't access.

## Obstacles encountered in the process
I really didn't encounter any large obstacles in creating my sails project. The only real thing I can think of is commiting the
project to github. Since the app contained a large amount of files it couldn't be committed to Github through the web app.
Instead I had to create a clone of my repository so that I could push the app onto the repository. All things considered, this
app was incredibly easy to set up and get running.
